# Lesson 6

## Node Debugger Commands

`run` runs the script

`list(5)` list scripts source code (5 lines before and after

`cont` , `c` continue execution 

### Executing Expressions or Functions

The `exec` command can be used to access in-scope variables within the debugger

It can also be used to evaluate expressions or execute functions

`repl` command can also be used to evaluate expressions or execute functions. Within the REPL, you can access variables that are in scope at the point where program execution was paused 

### Setting and Clearing Breakpoints

Breakpoints can be set using the `sb()` command, and removed using the `cb()` command

`sb()` can be passed a number as an argument in order to set a breakpoint on the line specified. It can also be used without an argument to set a breakpoint on the current line

`cb()` takes two arguments, the name of the file and the line number 

`cb('break.js', 7)`

### Stepping Into Functions

`s` command can be used to step into inner functions (callbacks). When you reach the inner function invocation, you can use `s` to move into the execution of that function

`o` command is used to step out the function once inside
