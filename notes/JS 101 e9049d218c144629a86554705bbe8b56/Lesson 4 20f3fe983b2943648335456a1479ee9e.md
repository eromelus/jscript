# Lesson 4

## Array methods

### Array.prototype.forEach

`for each` is a method called on an array. The method takes a function as an argument, `() => {...}`  this function expression provided to the method as an argument is called a **callback**

The code within the **callback** is executed for each iteration

`for each` also passes a second argument, index position of the element, to the callback function

```jsx
let obj = {key: value ...}
let objectKeyValues = Object.entries(obj);
objectKeyValues.forEach((keyValue) => {
	let [key, value] = keyValue;
	console.log(`${key}: ${value)`);
});
```

`let [key, value] = keyValue` is an example of array destructuring where we can assign elements of the array to multiple variables by wrapping the elements in brackets

`for each` **ALWAYS** returns `undefined`

### Array.prototype.filter

`filter` performs selection based on the `truthiness` of the callback's return value. If the callback are all `truthy` then `filter` will select all of the elements

### Array.prototype.map

`map` performs transformation based on the return value of the callback. If there is no explicit return statement `map` will return an array of `undefined`.

### Array.prototype.reduce

`reduce` takes two arguments: a callback function and a value that initializes the accumulator. The callback function takes two arguments as well: an element from the array and the current value of the accumulator.

The callback function executes on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value
