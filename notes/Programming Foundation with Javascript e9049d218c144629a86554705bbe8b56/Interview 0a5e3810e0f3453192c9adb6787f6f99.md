## Pedac script

### Problem

- Read the problem
- Ask the interviewer clarifying questions involving the problem

**"I‚Äôm going to start by breaking this problem down into its input and output‚Äù**

- **Write out the input and output**
- Write out explicit rules (if needed)

### Example/ Test Cases

- **Talk through examples/ test cases**
- Write implicit rules from the examples/ test cases (if needed)

### Algorithm

- **Use a small, concrete examples to determine what needs to be done**
- **Then write out algorithm**
- **Solve for simplest test case first**

"Just thinking at a high level, to solve this problem I would ‚Ä¶.‚Äù

### Code

**"I'm going to declare the function ___ with the parameter ___. I'm also going to write out this `console.log` with the function ___ passed into it as an argument so I can test while I code** 

"Before jumping into coding I want to make sure I have the right methods in mind"

‚ÄúBefore I use this method, let me test it out and see if it works the way I think it does.‚Äù 

- **Test while you code and mention what it should output**

‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt the result I expected, I'm going to go back and review the algorithm to see if I need to make any changes there first before revising the code.‚Äù

- Switch from code implementation mode to abstract problem solving mode when necessary
- Don't try to problem solve at the code level

### Speaking to Interviewer

That's a great point!

Yes you're right!

I see exactly what you mean!

```jsx
/*
-
-
-
go through test cases

input -
output -

write out algorithm

*/
```
